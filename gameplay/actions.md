# Character Actions


## Check

A check is roll to check if the character can preform a action, or to see how well they preform an action. 


The player must roll higher than the Challenge Level(**CL**) for the action to be considered a success.


The default **CL** is `10` unless the GM specifics otherwise. 


In addition to the dice the player adds modifiers to their roll.


{% clip Basic Check %}

The player add one applicable **ATTRIBUTE** from their character sheet to their roll. They may also modify their roll with an applicable **SKILL** and/or **ITEM**.

## Applicable Rule

Any **ITEM**, **SKILL**, or **ATTRIBUTE** that could logically be used in the action is considered applicable. 
However the GM gets ultimate say in what counts as applicable.

> A cooking skill would not be applicable in combat. 
> It would be applicable when detecting ingredients in a dish.


Some rolls will specify the attribute. For example a STRIKE requires the strength attribute be used.





## Examples

> Jason the wizard inspects the prison cell for clues.
> Jason has a magnifying glass(ITEM) and a Detect Aura spell(SKILL).
>
> The magnifying glass adds `1` to the roll,
> and the Detect Aura spell adds `3`.
>
> Jason gets `9` on the D20
> and he has `2` points in inelegance(INT)
>
> `9(D20) + 2(INT attribute) + 3(Detect Aura) + 1(Magnifying Glass) = 15`
> 
> The **CL** was `12` so its a success.
> Jason finds a murderous aura and the scent of a name, "Denis Fangs".
