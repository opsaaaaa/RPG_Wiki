## overview

Every player may add a magic skill to their character sheet.
The number of points in their magic skill determine the amount of mana points a character has.

3 points in magic grants a character 3 mana points.

> Perhaps different professions and races add bonus mana. 
> A *Wizard* could have a additional 5 mana while *Druid* could gain an additional 2.


Each spell has a level. 
Casting a spell uses up mana equivalent to spells level.
A Level 1 spell would use 1 mana while a level 3 spell would use 3 mana points.


Character would each recover their mana after a good nights rest.


## Cantrips

A level 0 spell is a cantrip. 
These should be small spells like telepathic messaging or creating a sphere of light.
A level 0 cantrip should have no damage potential.
However they require next to no mana.


## Magic Combat Mechanics

In combat the attack type spells, like a fire balls, 
act like any other ranged weapon. 
{% clip Hit Check Magic %}
In this case the combat skill is your magic skill. 

You also determining the damage the same way.
Assign your spells a weapon damage just like you would a axe or sword.
Use the spell level as the default value for its weapon damage.

For ranged attack spells {% clip Ranged Damage %}.

For melee attack spells {% clip Melee Damage %} 

Spells may define custom rules for doing damage. They may use a **D4** instead of a **D6** for example.


### Type Advantage/ Disadvantage

Use the normal advantage/ disadvantage system for spell type advantages.
like Clerical spells vs the Undead or Water spells vs Fire Elemental.

Default to disadvantages for the defending party unless granting the attacker an advantage makes more sense at the time.

## Spells Content

D&Ds spell catalog could make for some good inspiration.

## Upgrading Spells

Perhaps a character can upgrade their spell throughout a campaign.
they could spend Destiny Points at key moments in the story to level up their spells.

For example:

> Tulip had nowhere left to run. Cornered she face the mutant zombie. 
> Terrified of death, she begged Baldur, God of Light to save her.
> She cast the only spell she had left, A minor lighting spell.
> Her devotion paid off. 
> In that moment the level zero lighting spell shifted into a blinding purification spell.
> Her dim surrounding became far to vibrant to look at. 
> A pure holly light vaporized the walking corpse freeing its soul from the decaying prison.
> The light faded leaving wisps of ash and a stale taste in the air.
