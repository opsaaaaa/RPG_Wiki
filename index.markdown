# {{ page.title }}



Horde roleplay is an experimental table top roleplay system.
Its partly inspired by Pathfinder, Cogent Roleplay, and D&D.

The idea is to create a roleplay system that improves the gameplay experience.


# The Goals


We want players to spend less time acting as accountant and more time roleplaying.

We want to keep combat encounters short and engaging.
Reduce the amount of time players are doing math or looking up rules.

We would like to reduce and simplify the variables players are interacting with. 
And provide Character stats that are satisfying to use.

We would like this system to be both flexible and convenient.
GMs and players should be able to adapt and invent content easily.
