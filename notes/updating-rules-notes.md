## Round Order
Role a `DEX + D20` to determine the round order.
If a character roles over `20` then that character gets a second turn located at the amount they role above `20`.

## Hit Checks
to see if a player hit, roll `D20 + Combat Skill`.
combat skill being any skill the GM decides can be effective in combat.

# Counters
Plays have two actions and they can use these actions to do counters. 
in order to do damage the hit check must exceed the counter.
in the absents of a counter the hit check must exceed their targets dexterity.

## Damage System
`STR + WD * D6` in melee combat.
`WD * D6` in ranged combat.

The damage is reduced by the targets armor. Armor being STR, and any armor items or class/race bonuses.

## Advantage / Disadvantage
Roll Multiple times and take the lowest/ highest value.

## Multiple Actions
Characters have two actions per turn. if they do the same action twice. like punching the same enemy twice. then its acts the same as and advantage.
SO you role the **D20** twice and use the better number.
