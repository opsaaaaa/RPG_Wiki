# The Goals For Horde Roleplay


We want players to spend less time acting as accountant and more time roleplaying.

We want to keep combat encounters short and engaging.
Reduce the amount of time players are doing math or looking up rules.

We would like to reduce and simplify the variables players are interacting with. 
And provide Character stats that are satisfying to use.

We would like this system to be flexible. 
GMs and players should be able to adapt and invent content easily.
